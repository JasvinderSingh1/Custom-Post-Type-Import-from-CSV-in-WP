    1740 Broadway was built in 1950 as the Mutual of New York Building (famously abbreviated to
    the MONY Building) and was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, the architects who
    designed the Empire State Building. Until 2007 the most famous attribute of the building was a
    sign at the top of its façade advertising the Mutual of New York, spelling out the name with the
    first letter of each word (MONY) in bright red neon lighting twice the size of rest of the letters.
    This sign inspired the hit 1968 single “Mony Mony” by Tommy James and Shondells, which was
    famously covered by Billy Idol in 1981. Additionally, the sign was used as a motif in the 1969
    film Midnight Cowboy.<br>

The Yard is a revolutionary  shared space community where driven professionals can work together in an  innovative community. With locations in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and  Washington, DC, the company continues its mission to support growing and  established companies and offer them access to unparalleled opportunities.
